# Gungnir
A Language ( that is not superior at programming)

How to use

1.Install Scala (, Java)

2.Compile files, i.e. use compile.bat
(On terminal)
> compile

3.make a script file
e.g.

var F
var m
var a
equation F = ma

4. launch scale with this code
(On terminal)
> scala com.yamanogusha.scale.Launcher (script file names)
(If you give Scale no scripts, Scale launch with no matter.)

5. Input substitutions in REPL
e.g.
m = 2
a = 2
F = 4

All substitutions keep equations had been defined.
